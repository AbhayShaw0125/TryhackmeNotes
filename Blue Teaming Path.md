**Organisations don’t rely on a single tool or method to stay secure — they build layers of defence, much like an onion or many layers to a castle. 
We call this "Defence in Depth," meaning that if one security measure fails, we have others to rely upon at various stages.**

Example of Defensive Measure Includes:
1. Employee Training - consider phising
2. IDS
3. FireWalls
4. Security Policies


Soc (Security Operation Center) Analyst Daily task:
1. Review alerts triggered by security tooling
2.  Investigating anomalies
3. Responding to incidents


### SIEM ( Security Information and Event Management)
Its like a control center
Are central place for all data and information collected security devices , workstation servers and more within organizations.
Much like radar sweeping the digital environment, as they offer insight into what is happening within the organisation's IT.
