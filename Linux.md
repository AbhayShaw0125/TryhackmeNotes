Echo command
1. If we echo single word we write
```bash
echo Hello
   ```
   2. But if we echo multiple words we spaces better use within  - ""
   ```bash
   echo "Hello World!"
   ```

## Find

1. Instead of cd and ls all folder to find a file we can use name of the file to find it.

2. Now we don't know file name but we know the extension :

we use '*' as wild character to find anything ending with extension '.txt'

## Grep
Helps search content of files or specific value that we are looking for.
